Part 23-

We first have an issue with the setup method, we have to change it to adapt to new image-
formats, our attack images are 16x32, different than tileSize

We have issues with the attack left and attack up images so we need to change the screen X- 
and Y of both of these 2 cases. one tile to the left for left and one tile change for up.
So we created temporary values for screenx and screeny

We created a rectangle for hit detection, we can change width height etc.. based on what
weapon but for now we keep it one in player class constructor

(to make the player attack while moving)
you remove the else after the if(attacking == true) condition in the update method
 , in player
 
 
 UPDATE from Mr Snow, I didnt implement anything yet(if u find issues) do it.
When I adjusted player's worldX/Y for the attackArea, I added attackArea.height for the "down" and attackArea.width for the "right" case but both should have been gp.tileSize since we're basically checking the next tile. The difference was subtle so I didn't notice it until today!

If you want to show the attackArea on the screen, type the following code in player's draw method:
		// DEBUG
		// AttackArea
		tempScreenX = screenX + solidArea.x;
		tempScreenY = screenY + solidArea.y;		
		switch(direction) {
		case "up": tempScreenY = screenY - attackArea.height; break;
		case "down": tempScreenY = screenY + gp.tileSize; break; 
		case "left": tempScreenX = screenX - attackArea.width; break;
		case "right": tempScreenX = screenX + gp.tileSize; break;
		}				
		g2.setColor(Color.red);
                g2.setStroke(new BasicStroke(1));
		g2.drawRect(tempScreenX, tempScreenY, attackArea.width, attackArea.height);
		
		
		
		Part 24- Im having a big null problem on sounds got a null problem with 6 and 7
