Part 35- we did the options screen in options state in UI learned alot of stuff like checkbox
and progress bar etc...
part 36- Learned how to save files using text with buffered Reader and buffered Writer. 
we write using buffered reader and read each line in buffered writer and redo all the configs

part 37 is about when the player dies, he has to respawn

While doing this I got angry that fullScreen Failed and I was determined to get it working. 
I did and there is some stuff to fix. but everything else is fine!

We did methods for retry and quit, the retry method was to restore player position but keep
some stuff,
and when we quit we have a restart method. which restarts the entire game even if we dont
press quit

Part 38- First we transformed our 2D array to a 3D array
and also we have an issue finding same objs and npcs in the worldX and Y of other maps so 
the objs and monsters etc... npcs... will have 2D array one with mapIndex and one which obj

Now the issues with that is that our IDE shows errors but not even close to all when we
transform the 1D array to a 2D array, like != null doesnt show error, even though it is!
or also the length of the array. now we have 2 dimensions and each dimension has its own
length... Java automatically takes the length of the first dimension
