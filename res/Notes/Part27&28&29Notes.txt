Part 27- We implemented inventory and characterState


Part 28-
I didnt write in time, but now we are able to equip items and stuff and we are updating
the getPlayerAttackImg(), thats where we add the new animations

Part 29- We are implementing projectiles, we have a fireball, I am thinking of adding many
projectiles and I am thinking to remove proj in setDefValues and add it only if player is 
magician, and then swords, staff, etc will be unlockable in the future

IDEA!!! I want to add levels in the game where npc bad people shoot projectiles at player,
all player does is dodge

We added a parameter to damageMonster since when we have a weapon, attack strength depends
on weapon + strength while when we damage using projectile, we only use projectile attack
