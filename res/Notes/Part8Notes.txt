In part 8 we found out another way of checking collisions, the intersect method from the
Rectangle class, it checks intersection between 2 rectangles.
Also we used the old mechanics of our cChecker (collision checker) we just added some if
statements, and we also will use the collision mechanics (intersect) to pick up items, and 
more.

The REAL reason we didn't use intersect method for tiles is that in our current collision
method we are only checking for 2 tiles, while intersect has to check for all the tiles in
the screen, this would make the while loop's n (complexity) MASSIVE so our game will run 
slower. 

In the objects we are only checking for the limited amount of objects we have so its ok 
(thats why I commented before about the amount of objects (the more the slower the program)

!!!!! This gave me an idea for my game to open some doors using keys maybe in a dungeon,
and some doors can be re opened and closed after an interval of time, so first it disappears
and then after some time it reappears
