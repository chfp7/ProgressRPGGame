explanation of part 40 is available here. Pathfinding, it is a programming algorithm that is
used in videogames so the NPC can calculate the best path automatically , we could do these
manually but it would take alot of code and it is bothersome, so lets bother ourselves for
some time and learn this algorithm

Part 41- We added a feature that lets us break the projectile by attacking it and a knockback
effect that is just moving opposite direction with a certain speed. using a knockBack method

Part42- Object Detection which doesn't work THAT WELL yet. now we can detect doors and chest
better, not a huge deal 

Part 43- Stackable items we changed the code quite alot, and now we can just stack some items
instead of them taking too much space

Part 44- We have an environment system now, we can change weather, lighting and so many things
using it. we basically implemented a Gradient method in Lighting class. with array of colors
and floats. each float with a different shade of darkness. now we implement light object 

Part 45- We changed up the code when we added the Lighting object a lantern, it is equipable 
and when we equip it we toggle the lightUpdated method. and boolean. our variable is lightRadius
and we can add many light type objects
