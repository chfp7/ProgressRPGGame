This notes will be for part 9 and 10

Part 9- We first placed an object (Boots) to power up, which gives me ideas to also have
negative power down objects, for penalties, etc...

We use BeepBox to create sound and music, or also Incredibox (maybe)

We made a sound system so for music we do some methods in gamepanel and we just add sound
effects when we need for example in objects we just add the effects in the switch

Part 10- We fixed a small bug and now we will handle a UI system to make the game more fun
with buttons and text and other stuff. 

We found out that using new instances (new Font()) is bad since we are on a game thread and 
we are on 60 FPS so we will instantiate font 60 times per second, this will definitely fuck
up our game

We also found that when we draw Strings in our screen, the x axis works the same but y works
differently, the y in images works from the top of the image, while on String it works from
the baseline (not bottom) baseline.

Officially after part 10 I can create my own, but simple, games!
