In part 5 we changed alot of the mechanics, If I want to create a game based only on the-
screen size it is enough for me to learn until part 4 and other additional information. 
Now we are going to change the dynamic of the game. Our blueboy used to move and is limited
to the screen. Now he will be at the center and the map will move.
Also we are going to change the TileManager while loop to support bigger maps. a World Map

Step 1- All worldY and worldX int used to be x and y only, when the character was able to
move.

Step 2- Placing the screenX and Y will help us move the screen (like a camera). While world
x and y are where the Character exists in that map. But the character will be in the middle
of the screen always.

There are many things to be understood yet from part 5 like the if statement that lets us
render. Or how we changed the whole mapLoader to fit an entire World relative to the player
But! we shall work
