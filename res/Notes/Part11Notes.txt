Part 11- We are going to optimize our code as much as we can because the game I want to work 
on is heavy and we dont want the game to be any slow on ANY computer

What we did first is we used to instantiate a *new* buffered image every time while rendering
tiles, now we have a function for that and instantiate prior the game loop. so it takes less
memory and less time. we used the UtilityTools class we created and did the scaling there

We did the same for tiles, our player, and the objects.
The difference was a bit notable but it will only be very notable when we have a HUGE game
