Mr Snow is finding issues with rendering, so we changed alot of our code, like Objects- 
extending Entity class instead of SuperObject which now is deleted. I personally find the 
old code better, I saved it aside, but I dont want any future errors so Ill do the same

//!also moved to Player class
		
		//OBJECT
		for(int i = 0; i<obj.length; i++) {
			//we cannot draw object if there is null places in array. so we use if statement
			if(obj[i] != null) {
				
			obj[i].draw(g2, this);
			
			}
			
		}
		//NPC part 14
		for(int i = 0; i<npc.length; i++) {
			//we cannot draw object if there is null places in array. so we use if statement
			if(npc[i] != null) {
				
			npc[i].draw(g2);
			
		    }
		}
		
		//PLAYER
		player.draw(g2);
		 
		 We deleted all of this from the Gamepanel ELse class in the paint component method
		 
		 
		 
		 Everything is back to normal!
