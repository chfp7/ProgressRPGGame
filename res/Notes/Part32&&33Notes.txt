Part33- We created new class and package interactive tiles, we are now able to cut dry trees
we just handle collision in the attacking method and we put null to make tree disappear. 

now we want to implement a tree trunk placement after we break the tree, mr snow had 2 methods,
one method was to just setup  a tree trunk tile and place it on map, very lazy way... other
was to make it an object which is better since I want to remove that tile

the getDamagedTile function is super useful for item removal and item placement also.
its the same mechanism but we add a new button for placement

I have an idea to lock certain places until player finds the object for it

Part 34- up until now (rewatch part 34 video), we have been directly extending g2 to JPanel
, since mr snow didnt plan full screen. now we are rendering everything into an image drawn
by g2 (tempScreen), and implementing it into JPanel
