Part 39-
first we will add a transitioning effect

Part 40- Came into alooooot of trouble worked from 6PM till 2:40 AM...
solution was a simple solid area and complicated problems.. but now its good. to make the 
entity follow a path activate last line in searchPath. we can use this when we attack monsters
and if we need some help.

REMEMBER! red color in the draw tiles method. and also now you can make monsters aggressive.
they can find you now. npc can go where you want him to go. implement that in each class 
and please fix and try to understand that code more
